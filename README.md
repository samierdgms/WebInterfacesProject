Today, I’d like to introduce you to my project, which is an interactive comment platform. This platform allows users to interact socially by posting comments, liking them, and even updating their profile information. Let me walk you through its key features:

Backoffice: This project includes a management panel, where administrative actions can be performed, such as CRUD operations on users. For example, administrators have the ability to delete users directly from the backoffice.

Dashboard: The dashboard provides a personalized space where users can update their profile pictures and add new comments to the platform.

Frontoffice: In the frontoffice, all user comments are displayed in an organized way. Additionally, there’s a search box that allows filtering comments based on usernames, making it easy to find specific interactions. Each comment also includes a like button, so users can engage with posts they find interesting or meaningful.

API Integration: All data is fetched and updated dynamically using a REST API, specifically Sheety API in this case. This ensures seamless and efficient data handling for both users and administrators.

Responsive Design: The platform is fully responsive, meaning it works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices. This ensures a smooth user experience regardless of the device being used.

Purpose: The goal of this platform is to create a social space for interaction while also providing tools for effective data management through an admin panel. It serves as a practical learning project for implementing key web development concepts such as CRUD operations, API integration, and user interaction.
